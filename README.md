# uber-data-project

Created an ETL pipeline using the open-source data pipeline tool called Mage. The pipeline is designed to process the etl job for data stored in a GCP Bucket. Then, used the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to store the raw data, Compute Engine (VM/SSH Instance) to run Mage, and BigQuery to store the transformed data for analysis. Finally, utilized Looker Studio to create an interactive dashboard for data visualization and insights.
